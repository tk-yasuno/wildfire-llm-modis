## 🔥 Satellite-Based Wildfire Detection Using LLMs (MODIS Implementation Guide)

**Overview**  
As global wildfire risks continue to rise due to climate anomalies and prolonged dry seasons, this project proposes an AI-based early detection system leveraging NASA MODIS satellite imagery and large language models (LLMs). The MVP provides automated fire risk assessment by extracting wildfire indicators—such as smoke, flame patterns, and thermal anomalies—from imagery, and presenting them in structured natural language analysis.

**Key Features**  
- 🛰️ **Satellite Input**: Near-real-time MODIS imagery retrieved via NASA ORNL DAAC APIs  
- 🧠 **LLM Analysis**: Textual inference of fire characteristics using Qwen2-LV-2B  
- 🧪 **Risk Scoring**: Multi-factor fire risk quantification with explainable components  
- 📊 **Dashboard**: Streamlit-based interface for risk visualization and FastAPI endpoint for alert distribution  
- 📁 **Data Support**: MOD13Q1 (vegetation), MOD11A1 (surface temperature), MOD14A1 (fire detection)
